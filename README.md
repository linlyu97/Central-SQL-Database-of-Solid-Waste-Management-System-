# Central-SQL-Database-of-Solid-Waste-Management-System

Basic Projects Introduction

This database intends to document Solid Waste Management System ( SWMS) related data around the world with a focus in the U.S. and 
EU for the Bee2Waste Crypto project. This database collects data of waste characterization, technologies, best management practices, and system configurations for solid wastes generated by the public sector (e.g. municipal solid waste (MSW), construction and demolition (C&D) debris, electronic wastes, disaster debris, etc.). Besides, this database attempts to capture the socioeconomic contexts as well as performance metrics of SWMS, including economic benefits, environmental footprints, and societal elements.
